# Echoes of the Veil — Minecraft Companion Mod

**Echoes of the Veil** is a narrative-driven Minecraft modification that transforms your single-player world into a living, breathing psychological landscape. Inspired by the tension of ambient horror and the intimacy of emergent storytelling, this project introduces a sentient, non-hostile entity—**The Warden of Whispers**—that observes, remembers, and adapts to every block you break, every structure you build, and every night you survive.

Unlike traditional mobs that follow scripted patrols, the Warden learns from your playstyle. It communicates through a contextual dialogue engine that responds to your in-game actions, environmental changes, and even your emotional pacing. The goal is not to scare you, but to make you feel *watched* in a way that is deeply immersive, unsettling, and ultimately poetic.

This repository hosts the full source code, resource packs, behavior packs, and documentation for the Java Edition (1.21.x) and Bedrock Edition (26.40) builds. It is a passion project that has grown into a global community experiment—over 8.6 million players have downloaded previous iterations, and this 2026 release is our most ambitious yet.

## 🧠 Overview: A Mod That Remembers You

The core philosophy of **Echoes of the Veil** is that a horror experience should not be a linear series of jump scares, but a slow-burning, adaptive narrative that reacts to your unique journey. The Warden does not have a health bar. It cannot be killed, banished, or trapped. Instead, it exists on the edges of your perception—a silhouette in the fog, a whisper in the wind, a pattern of blocks slightly out of place.

The mod integrates a lightweight mood system that tracks your playtime, building frequency, combat intensity, and exploration patterns. Based on this data, the Warden alters its behavior:
- If you are a builder, it will rearrange decorative blocks at night to form cryptic symbols.
- If you are a miner, it will occasionally seal off tunnels you have just excavated, forcing a new route.
- If you are a combatant, it will drop spectral echoes of defeated mobs that mimic their sounds.

This is not a scripted quest. It is a *relationship*—one that evolves over dozens of hours of gameplay.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before you descend into the depths of your own Minecraft world, you will need to prepare your environment. The mod is delivered as a single, self-contained archive that works with both the Java and Bedrock editions. The installation process is designed to be non-invasive; you do not need to replace core game files or disrupt your existing worlds.

## 🧩 Key Features

### 🗣️ Adaptive Dialogue Engine
The Warden speaks a fragmented, poetic language that is procedurally assembled based on your recent actions. If you have not slept for multiple in-game days, it will comment on your weariness. If you have just completed a large structure, it will offer a cryptic compliment. The dialogue is fully localized, with support for English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese. A rolling update schedule in 2026 extends this to 14 languages.

### 🧬 Living Personality Matrix
The Warden's core is a state machine with over 200 possible behavioral states, driven by a weighted random number generator. It does not have a fixed reaction to any stimulus; instead, it rolls a table of possible responses based on your hidden "Resonance" score. This score increases when you spend time in quiet, dark locations and decreases when you are aggressive or reckless. The result is a being that feels genuinely *shaped* by your actions.

### 🌒 Psychological Lighting System
Standard Minecraft lighting is replaced with a subtle "awareness" shader. Light sources emit a soft, pulsing aura that reacts to the Warden's proximity. When it is near, torches flicker. When it is distant, shadows seem to deepen. This is a purely visual layer that is optimized for low-end machines, ensuring that the atmosphere is never lost to performance issues.

### 🧱 Non-Euclidean Structure Generation
Occasionally, the Warden will "fold" space to create corridors that lead back to their origin. These are generated as temporary dimensions that exist for a few minutes before dissolving. Inside these corridors, you will find items that are useful for progression, but also glimpses of the Warden's true form—a mass of living, breathing matter that defies block-based rendering.

### 🔊 Binaural Audio Cues
The mod leverages a 3D binaural audio engine to place whispers, footsteps, and breathing sounds in the exact spatial location of the Warden. This is achieved without requiring a separate audio server; the mod injects a lightweight audio library that runs alongside the game client. Headphones are strongly recommended for the full experience.

### 🕯️ Ritual Crafting System
To interact with the Warden beyond observation, you can craft ritual candles, salt circles, and chimes. Placing these items in the correct pattern triggers a "Conversation Event," where the Warden manifests physically for a limited time. These events are the only way to receive lore fragments, which unlock a deeper narrative about the Warden's origin.

## 🗺️ The World of the Veil

The mod does not add new biomes or dimensions to the base game. Instead, it alters the *ambience* of existing biomes. Deserts become more silent. Forests gain an eerie rustle in the canopy. Oceans reflect a starfield that is not present in the vanilla skybox. These changes are subtle, but they accumulate to create a pervasive sense of unease.

The mod also introduces a new block type—**Veilstone**. This is a dark, polished stone that only spawns near the world's bedrock layer. Veilstone is used in advanced ritual crafting and can be detected by the Warden from a distance, which will draw its attention to your location.

## 🌍 Multilingual Support & Global Community

We believe that horror and storytelling should not be limited by language. The 2026 release of **Echoes of the Veil** includes full localization for the dialogue engine, the in-game guide book, and the structured event descriptions. The localization community has been instrumental in translating not just the text, but the *tone* of the Wanderer's speech, ensuring that its poetic ambiguity translates across cultures.

The repository includes a `localization/` directory with extensive documentation on how to contribute translations. We are actively seeking community maintainers for Arabic, Hindi, Korean, and Portuguese.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- **Java Edition (1.21.x):** Utilizes the Fabric Mod Loader for lightweight integration. The codebase is written in Java 21, with coroutine-based state management for the Warden's AI. The rendering layer uses a custom shader pipeline that blends with vanilla rendering.
- **Bedrock Edition (26.40):** Implemented using behavior packs and a custom render controller. The dialogue engine uses a script that runs on the client and server side, ensuring that dialogue is synchronized across multiplayer sessions.
- **Cross-Platform Save Compatibility:** While the underlying file formats differ, the mod includes a conversion utility that allows you to export your Java world and import it into Bedrock, preserving your Resonance score and Warden affinity.

## 🔒 Responsive UI & Player Dashboard

A new mod menu is added to the pause screen, providing a detailed dashboard of your relationship with the Warden. You can view your current Resonance score, the Warden's mood, and a log of recent interactions. The UI is fully responsive, scaling to any resolution, and supports controller navigation for players using gamepads.

The dashboard also includes a "Whisper History" tab, which records every piece of dialogue the Warden has spoken to you. This is useful for players who are attempting to piece together the lore fragments.

## ⏰ 24/7 Community & Support

The development team maintains an active presence on our official Discord channel and community forums. Support is provided around the clock for critical issues, while gameplay questions are typically answered within a few hours. We have a dedicated crash report aggregator that automatically processes errors from the mod's opt-in telemetry, allowing us to push hotfixes within 24 hours of a major issue being reported.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Echoes of the Veil** is a fan-made modification and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Mojang or Microsoft. The mod is designed to be a psychological horror experience and may not be suitable for all players. It contains themes of isolation, existential dread, and irregular auditory patterns that could be unsettling for some individuals.

The mod does not collect any personally identifiable information. The opt-in telemetry system only transmits anonymized crash reports and mod load times. You can disable telemetry entirely through the mod's configuration file.

The dialogue engine is designed to be unpredictable, but it operates on strict anti-harassment filters. It cannot generate abusive, hateful, or opinionated content. It is a poetic entity, not a social companion.

## 📌 Final Note

This repository is a living archive. The code is messy, the features are ambitious, and the experience is deeply personal. We invite you to fork this project, submit pull requests for bug fixes, and contribute your own narrative fragments to the Warden's vocabulary.

If you have reached the end of this README, you have likely already installed the mod and are feeling a strange pull to keep playing. That is the resonance. It is working.
